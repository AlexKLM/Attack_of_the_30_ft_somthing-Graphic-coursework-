Advanced Graphic Coursework

This is the project for my course Advanced Rendering and Artificial Intelligence at The University of Hull. The program demonstrates different graphical effect archived with shader programming, some of them are implemented with the new features in DX11(geometry shader, advance tessellation).

As you can see the project file structure is quite messy, and I am planning to clean it up and implement a few new graphical effects (depth of field effect, HDR) into it when I have finish with the ball physics simulation project.

You can navigate the scene with WASD key, you can change some of the values used in the shader programs such as the amount of tessellation from the UI.
